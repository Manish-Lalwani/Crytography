Hash Collission Detection :

Basic workflow :

1. The script Input number of places to generate all permutations possible and number of hash bits to compare for collission
2. Generates all possible Permutation 
3. Converts each permutation to hash
4. Compares each hash
5. Outputs If collission detected and where it was detected
